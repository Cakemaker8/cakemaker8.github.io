            <h1>Graduate School Finder</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the graduate school finder tool! This tool can be used to help 
                assist in finding a graduate school that matches the program and field 
                you are interested in. The data used in this website comes from the NCES 
                IPEDS data for 2022-23. As newer finalized versions are posted, it 
                will be updated here. It hosts a local copy, so any changes or removals 
                from .gov websites will not be reflected here.</p>
            <p>The field, program, and subprogram options are identified from their CIP Code. 
                If you would like more information regarding any of the options, 
                visit this website: <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/browse.aspx?y=56">

            <p><br>Use this tool at your own risk. This tool only provides suggestions based 
                on your inputs, and may not provide the correct option. It should only be used 
                to see what schools are available based on your criteria, and not the schools 
                you must apply to or attend.</p>
