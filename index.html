            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the website of Cakemaker8 (Madeline Potter).</p>
            <p>I am currently a student at the University of South Alabama, majoring 
                in computer engineering. I have an extensive background in research, 
                especially in the fields of artificial intelligence, embedded systems, 
                and graph theory. My post-graduation goals are to pursue 
                PhD in computer engineering, focusing on intelligent systems 
                and graph theory.</p>
            <p>This website will feature any tools that I make and updates with 
                the projects that I am currently working on. You can check out everything 
                with the links at the top of this website.</p>
